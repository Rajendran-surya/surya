Or, more accurately, according to Josh Bersin, “The <br>future of work is already here.” So yes, the robots are coming. These <br>robots aren’t physical machines; they’re software “bots” installed on <br>desktop computers or in the cloud that can be configured to automate<br> increasingly complex tasks, such as moving, manipulating, and <br>validating data.</p>

 <p id="passs">Tesla has said that its cost of operation for the Semi will help shippers<br> save money on a per mile basis right away, and that’s likely meant to <br>help lessen the impact of sticker shock when it finally does reveal the<br> upfront price. But as I mentioned with the Walmart pilot, which will <br>involve a trial of 15 Semi trucks across the U.S. and Canada, there’s <br>additional value in helping these major shippers meet their green <br>targets.</p>
